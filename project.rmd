# Introduction

This report summaries the Bayesian analysis of the Reisby data-set. The Reisby data-set is based on a 5 week (first placebo) psychiatric study which investigates response of depressed patients to IMI. The Bayesian analysis will investigate how the drug affects depression. 

# Data Setup and Cleaning

## Data

The data is loaded from a .Rdata file containing the Riesby data-set introduced in the introduction.

```{r data, echo=FALSE}

load("Reisby.RData")
Reisby = as.data.frame(Reisby)

```

## Data Exploration

### Correlation (Pairs Plot)

```{r pairs, echo = FALSE}

kable(cor(Reisby[,-1])) # no id

```

The strongest correlations are negative and weak-moderate, and occur between Hamilton index with week and DMI, and rather obvious as the increase in blood concentration of the antidepressant would alleviate depression over weeks of treatment. Most other correlations are weak to very weak.

\newpage

### Graphical Summaries 

#### Hamilton Scores

```{r ham-hist, echo=FALSE}

hist(Reisby$hd, main = "Hamilton Index Scores Histogram",
     xlab = "Hamilton Score")

```

Most Hamilton scores are above 20 (i.e. moderate and severe depression dominates against mild and normal)

#### Sex

```{r sex-hist, echo=FALSE}

# Replace x axis here with male/female axis

hist(Reisby$female, main = "Sex Histogram",
     xlab = "Sex", xaxt = "n", ylim = c(0, 200)) 
axis(1, at=0:1, labels=c("Male","Female"))

```

The female test subjects are overwhelmingly higher than the males (nearly double!).

\newpage

#### Endogenous vs Reactive (Depression Type)

```{r dep-type-hist, echo=FALSE}

hist(Reisby$reactive_depression, main = "Depression Type Histogram",
     xlab = "Depression Type", xaxt = "n", ylim = c(0, 150)) 
axis(1, at=0:1, labels=c("Endogenous","Reactive"))

```

Most Depression cases in the test population are Endogenous (i.e. not a reaction to an environmental event).

\newpage

#### DMI and IMI Concentrations

```{r dmi-imi-boxplot, echo=FALSE}

boxplot(Reisby$lnimi, Reisby$lndmi, main = "IMI and DMI Concentration Distributions",
        ylab = "Log Concentraion") 
axis(1, at=0:2, labels=c("IMI","IMI", "DMI")) # uses 3 labels due to strange bug

```

Generally tight distribution *especially around 25% to 75%) for both with little outlines with both distribution looking nearly identical sans the shift up with DMI. It seems that after being processed as DMI, the concentration of the antidepressant in the blood increases.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

### Weeks 

```{r clean-weeks, echo = FALSE}

placebo = c(ifelse(Reisby$week == 0, 1, 0))
  
```


There are going to be two weeks variables, the initial week number for Autoregressiona and Gaussian Proccess, and another or on whether it is a placebo week or not for linear regression. 

### Standardisation and Predictor Separation

The response (hamilton index) and predictors (everything else) are separated for the modelling stage. Two sets of predictors (x) are used, one for linear regression (uses placebo indicator for weeks) and one for other time series based methods (uses normal weeks). All non indicator variables are standardised using a to ensure a fair impacts between variables and easier uninformative prior selection.

```{r pred-sep, echo = FALSE}

lin_x = Reisby[,-1:-3]
lin_x$placebo = placebo
x = Reisby[,-1:-2]
y = Reisby[,1]

```


```{r std, echo = FALSE}

y_scaled = (y - mean(y))/sd(y)
scaled_dmi = (Reisby$lnimi - mean(Reisby$lnimi))/sd(Reisby$lnimi)
scaled_imi = (Reisby$lndmi - mean(Reisby$lndmi))/sd(Reisby$lndmi)

x_scaled = x[, -2:-3]
lin_x_scaled = lin_x[, -1:-2]

x_scaled$scaled_dmi = scaled_dmi
x_scaled$scaled_imi = scaled_imi
lin_x_scaled$scaled_dmi = scaled_dmi
lin_x_scaled$scaled_imi = scaled_imi

```
